# text-adventure-2

Travel through this open world text-based-adventure game as an immortal warrior known as Raidriar. 

Fight zombies, demons, and the evil sorcerer to free the lands of oz from their tyranical takeover 

Known bugs are: 

1. Health count does not transfer when you pass between levels. Always resets to full health which is currently set at 150 HP.

2. Some antagonists names show up incorrectly.


Working on an update to fix these bugs and add more complex gameplay. Aiming to be done around 01/06/2023
