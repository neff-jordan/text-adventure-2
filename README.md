# text-adventure-2

Travel through this open world text-based-adventure game as an immortal warrior known as Raidriar. 

Fight zombies, demons, and the evil sorcerer to free the lands of oz from their tyranical takeover 

Known bugs are: 

1. Health count does not transfer when you pass between levels. Always resets to full health which is currently set at 150 HP.

2. Some antagonists names show up incorrectly ✅✅✅

3. Check the sorceres attack, feels like it goes above the assigned attackDamage


Working on an update to fix these bugs and add more complex gameplay. Aiming to be done around 01/06/2023


Features to add: 

1. Magic damage for both the sorcerer and raidriar 
2. Add two more levels 
3. Give the demons the keys to the temple 
4. Write a deeper storyline 
5. Maybe add pickup/drop options
